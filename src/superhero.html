        <p>A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses
        supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling
        supervillains. A female <strong>superhero</strong> is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine
        or super heroine), although the word <strong>superhero</strong> is commonly used for females also. <strong>superhero</strong>        fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the
        1930s.
    </p>
    <p> By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes. <sup> <sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup><sup>[3]</sup>        </sup>

        While the Dictionary.com definition of "<strong>superhero</strong>" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or
        cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime", <sup>[4]</sup> longstanding
        Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also:an
        exceptionally skillful or successful person".<sup> [5]</sup> Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers
        or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred
        to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits. </p>

    <h3 id="1">History</h3>
    <h4 id="section-a">  Early history </h4>
    <p>The word '<strong>superhero</strong>' dates to at least 1917. <sup>[6]</sup> Antecedents of the archetype include such
        folkloric heroes as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.<sup>[7]</sup> The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel
        and its spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the <strong>superhero</strong> trope of a secret identity.
        <sup>[7]</sup> Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930)
        and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength,
        including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner
        (1930).
        <sup>[8]</sup> In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such
        as Japan's Ōgon Bat<sup>[9]</sup><sup>[10]</sup> (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers
        in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician<sup>[11][12][13]</sup> (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939)
        at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.</p>
    <h4 id="section-b">1940s</h4>
    <p>During the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era
        saw the debut of first known female <strong>superhero</strong>, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah,
        an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers
        to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay
        Flagg".
        <sup>[14]</sup><sup>[15]</sup> The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime
        saboteurs using the superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated
        newspaper comic strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.<sup>[16]</sup> </p>
    <p> One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary
        of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell — debuted in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely
        Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime-fighters during this era
        lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red,<sup>[17]</sup><sup>[18]</sup> introduced in Standard
        Comics' Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert The Spirit
        Section June 2, 1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in All-American Comics #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury,<sup>[19]</sup>        debuting in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced
        in Quality Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,<sup>[20]</sup><sup>[21]</sup> introduced in Harvey
        Comics' Pocket Comics #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) as a
        supporting character.<sup>[22]</sup> The most iconic comic book superheroine, who debuted during the Golden Age,
        is Wonder Woman.<sup>[23]</sup> Modeled from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist
        William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne.<sup>[24]</sup><sup>[25]</sup>        Wonder Woman's first appearance was in All Star Comics #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one
        of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944.</p>
    <h4 id=section-c> 1950s </h4>
    <p>In 1952, Osamu Tezuka's manga Tetsuwan Atom (more popularly known in the west as Astro Boy) was published. The series
        focused upon a robot boy built by a scientist to replace his deceased son. Being built from an incomplete robot originally
        intended for military purposes Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and
        the incredible mechanical strength of his limbs.</p>

    <p>The 1950s saw the Silver Age of Comics. During this era DC introduced the likes of Batwoman in 1956, Supergirl, Miss
        Arrowette, and Bat-Girl; all female derivatives of established male superheroes. 1958 saw the debut of <strong>superhero</strong>        Moonlight Mask on Japanese television. </p>
    <h4 id="section-d">1960s</h4>
    <p> The Marvel Comics teams of the early 1960s typically included at least one (and often the only) female member, much like
        DC's flagship <strong>superhero</strong> team the Justice League of America (whose initial roster included Wonder
        Woman as the token female); examples include the Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, the X-Men's Jean Grey (originally
        known as Marvel Girl), the Avengers' Wasp, and the Brotherhood of Mutants' Scarlet Witch (who later joined the Avengers).
        In 1963, Astro Boy was adapted into a highly influential anime television series. Phantom Agents in 1964 focused
        on ninjas working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for Sentai-type series. 1966 saw the debut
        of sci-fi/horror series Ultra Q created by Eiji Tsuburaya this would eventually lead on to the sequel Ultraman, spawning
        a successful franchise focused upon the Giant Hero subgenre where the Superheroes would be as big as giant monsters
        (Kaiju) that they fought.</p>

    <h4 id="2">1970s</h4>
    <p>In 1972, the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman anime debuted, which built upon the <strong>superhero</strong> team idea of
        the live-action Phantom Agents as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support
        them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of Mazinger Z by
        Go Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga Cutey Honey in 1973, although the Magical
        Girl genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical
        Girl media.</p>
    <p> The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into <strong>superhero</strong> fiction such examples included the debut
        of Shotaro Ishinomori's Skull Man in 1970, Go Nagai's Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John Romita's Punisher
        in 1974.</p>

    <h4>1980s onwards</h4>
    <p> In subsequent decades, popular characters like Dazzler, She-Hulk, Elektra, Catwoman, Witchblade, Spider-Girl, Batgirl
        and the Birds of Prey became stars of long-running eponymous titles. Female characters began assuming leadership
        roles in many ensemble <strong>superhero</strong> teams; the Uncanny X-Men series and its related spin-off titles
        in particular have included many female characters in pivotal roles since the 1970s.<sup>[30]</sup> Volume 4 of the
        X-Men comic book series featured an all-female team as part of the Marvel NOW! branding initiative in 2013.<sup>[31]</sup>        Superpowered female characters like Buffy the Vampire Slayer<sup>[32]</sup> and Darna<sup>[33]</sup><sup>[34]</sup>        have a tremendous influence on popular culture in their respective countries of origin.</p>
    <p> With more and more anime, manga and Tokusatsu being translated or adapted, western audiences were beginning to experience
        the Japanese styles of <strong>superhero</strong> fiction more than they were able to before. Saban's Mighty Morphin
        Power Rangers, an adaptation of Zyuranger created a multimedia franchise that used footage from Super Sentai.<sup>[35]</sup>        Internationally, the Japanese comic book character, Sailor Moon, is recognized as one of the most important and popular
        female superheroes ever created.</p>
    <h3>Common traits</h3>
    <p> Many <strong>superhero</strong> characters display the following traits:</p>
    <ul style="">
        <li> Extraordinary powers or abilities. <strong>superhero</strong> powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability
            to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird,
            the Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage
            techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons
            or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed
            by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or
            device (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer,
            and Wolverine's adamantium claws). </li>
        <li> A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
            of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
        <li>A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman),
            a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian
            service (e.g. Superman).</li>
        <li> A secret identity that protects the <strong>superhero</strong>'s friends and family from becoming targets of his
            or her enemies, such as Clark Kent (Superman), or to protect themselves from getting arrested by the police,
            like Spider-Man, although many superheroes have a confidant (usually a friend or relative who has been sworn
            to secrecy). Most superheroes use a descriptive or metaphoric code name for their public deeds. However, there
            are also rare ones whose true identities are common public knowledge, even with a costumed identity (e.g. Iron
            Man and Captain America). </li>
        <li>A distinctive costume, often used to conceal the secret identity (see Common costume features).</li>
        <li>An underlying motif or theme that affects the hero's name, costume, personal effects, and other aspects of his or
            her character (e.g. Batman wears a bat-inspired costume, uses bat-themed equipment, and operates at night; Spider-Man
            can project artificial webbing from wrist-mounted web shooting gadgets, has a spider web pattern on his costume,
            and other spider-like abilities).</li>
